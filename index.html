        <h1 class="mb-3">Christopher Lin
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undeclared ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Christopher Lin and I'm an Asian American student here at UC Riverside. It's currently my second year at UC Riverside and my major is still undeclared as I'm trying to figure out my future goals. I was born in San Francisco and spent my whole life there, that was until I moved out to college, of course. I have an older sister and being the youngest I had someone to look up to. I graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School back in 2022 and played 3 sports, Baseball for nine years, Football for two and Dragon Boat for two. UC RIverside was one of my top choices and I applied with a 3.0 GPA after thankfully overcoming a mentally tough year Iâ€™ve experienced. While my major choices are still up in the air, the major that sparked my interest the most was Sociology. Although being enrolled in lower division classes to declare into the major, Iâ€™m still unsure if the major is to my liking due to the reason of Sociology being too broad. Computer Science has also been another choice I had in the back of my mind.. <br><br>

        Some hobbies I enjoy doing outside of school include listening to music, hanging out with friends, and driving around in my car. I believe that these are the things that keep my mind off all the stress and anxiety throughout the day. Movies have been a crucial part of my life and kept my dreams going. Most of my favorite films were produced by Disney because my family would go every year since I was 2. To this day I still enjoy watching Star Wars, Cars, and Winnie the Pooh. Besides Disney movies, Harry Potter has always had a special place in my heart. My family and I have always enjoyed traveling around the world. Some of the places I have been to include China, Korea, Tokyo, Alaska, Mexico, Boston, New York, Seattle, and Canada. My favorite holiday and including my whole family is Christmas, hence why I was named Christopher, thanks Dad. As December comes near, it's the most wonderful time of the year since thatâ€™s my birth month as well.<br><br>

        A couple goals I have for the year include going to the gym more often, ending my second year with at least a 3.0, and to land a comfortable job thatâ€™ll allow me to manage school and work easier. Time management has been my toughest struggle throughout the college years. Through many mistakes and lessons learned, more tips and experiences has allowed me to learn this skill easier. Learning how to be an adult has not been easy but my motivation comes from these goals. Another goal I have is making more meaningful connections with family members and building deeper bonds through more communication and quality time spent together due to my time being away from home. Iâ€™ve been feeling disconnected from my family and there would be times I would plan a weekend to drive seven hours back home.
